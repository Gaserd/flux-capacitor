Some simple collaborative use case. Like editing a shared schedule or so.
Show list of all events.
Delete all events every night.
Show links to REST routes.
Use websockets for push notifications.
Mention command/event approach, compare to redux.
Mention push notifications, that there is no optimistic updating in the frontend.
Mention with how little effort / code this was possible.
Mention the power in tracking changes of critical data and debugging.
